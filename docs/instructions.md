# Usage Instructions

## Dependencies

Bitcoin Proxy requires a Bitcoin node to function. By default, Bitcoin Proxy will connect to the Bitcoin Core node running on your Embassy.

## Config

You must create at least one user to your Bitcoin Proxy config. Each user you create will receive their own RPC useranme and password, which can be used for remote access.

## Using a Wallet

Enter your user's QuickConnect QR code (located in `properties`) **OR** your raw user credentials (located in `Config`) into any wallet that supports connecting to a remote node over Tor.
